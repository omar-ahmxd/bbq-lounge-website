## Important Notes:
- EmailJS free plan allows 200 emails/month
- The email will be sent from EmailJS servers, not directly from Gmail
- Replies will go to the customer's email address (from_email field)
- Always keep your Public Key secure (though it's safe to use in frontend code)

## Troubleshooting:
- If emails aren't sending, check browser console for errors
- Verify all IDs are correctly entered
- Check EmailJS dashboard for email history and errors
- Ensure thebarbequelounge@gmail.com is verified in EmailJS
